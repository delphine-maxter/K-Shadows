<h1 class="title">Shadows of Kowloon</h1>
<div class="intro">
Step quietly into the heart of Kowloon, where history lingers in the brickwork and neon, and every alley has a secret. As dusk falls, the city’s familiar bustle gives way to whispers—echoes of vanished footsteps, flickers of forgotten lanterns, and tales that refuse to fade.
Tonight, you’ll trace a path through haunted churches, spectral markets, and storied temples. Some say the shadows here are deeper, the air colder, and the stories… not quite finished. Are you ready to walk where the living and the restless meet? The tour begins when the city’s lights flicker—and not all who listen to the tales will be seen.
